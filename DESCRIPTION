Title: A Framework of Functions to Combine, Analize and Interpret CNVs Calling Results 
Version: 0.99.13

Description: This package contains a set of functions to perform several type of 
    processing and analysis on CNVs calling pipelines/algorithms results in an 
    integrated manner and regardless of the raw data type (SNPs array or NGS). It 
    provides functions to combine multiple CNV calling results into a single object, 
    filter them, compute CNVRs (CNV Regions) and inheritance patterns, detect genic
    load, and more. The package is best suited for studies in human family-based 
    cohorts.
